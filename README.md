# GamuBlue: A User-Friendly Tool For Equilibrium Analysis

GamuBlue is a game-theory tool for analyzing equilibriums of games from a
security perspective.

This project aims to develop a user-friendly tool for equilibrium analysis
against coalitions and arbitrarily deviating players in a normal-form game. We
target arbitrary normal-form games with variable number of players and
strategies.

GamuBlue supports the following notions for equilibrium analysis:

- $k$-Resiliency
- $t$-Immunity
- $(k,t)$-Robustness
- $l$-Repellence
- $(l,t)$-Resistance
- $m$-Stability
